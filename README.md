# Task-Tracker-CLI
The Task Tracker CLI project is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help users track and manage their tasks. This tool allows users to add, update, delete tasks, and mark them as in-progress or completed. All tasks are stored in a JSON file, ensuring easy management and access to data.

Key Features  
* Add tasks: Users can add new tasks using the command `add "task description"`  
* Update and delete tasks: Commands `update [id] "new description"` and `delete [id]` allow users to update and delete tasks, respectively  
* Mark tasks: Commands `mark-in-progress [id]` and `mark-done [id]` allow users to mark tasks as in-progress or completed  
* List tasks: The command `list` displays all tasks, while `list done`, `list todo`, and `list in-progress` filter tasks by status
